# Overwatch Statistics Website

The objective of this coursework was to demonstrate my understanding and mastery of the Python Flask microframework by completing a personal project in which I designed, implemented and evaluated the web application which I created on a topic of my choosing.

The web application which I chose to create was a stat tracking site for the game ”Overwatch”. The aim of the website was to allow users to search players by name and see their top characters played and several stats about their performance. This was accomplished by interacting with the Overwatch API in order to populate the website based on the user being searched for, either by name or by their specific Battletag. 

The site itself contains a search page, a fully functional sign up & log-in, a profile page to view your own stats and a top players page which shows a list of the current top 100 players by rating.
